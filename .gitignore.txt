Hi, why do you have migrations in your .gitignore file?

Hi, why do you have migrations in your .gitignore file?

if you are working on the git and sometimes you get a lot of git issues due to migration conflicts in development. It's not recommended for production.

Migration files are part of the code base and should be committed.

Hello @opeerator

I agree but in some cases, due to migration conflict, I chose to ignore it.

Hello @santoshpurbey
What about data migrations?

Thank you for pointing import stuff about database migrations, I've created this gist for my use-case where I've faced migrations issue while working with git so I put it in git ignore file but aware of this and only useful for development environment but not for production where we need the most. Interesting fact: unexpectedly this gist appeared on top in google search.

Hello, i have site-packages and py_cache files, should i ignore them on my gitignore, besides poluting my git status i feel like it is not necessary files, they should only remain on the user's side. What do you guys think ?

@MrKyHn1
MrKyHn1 commented on Jan 8, 2021
to be more precise they are /py_cache files and venv/lib/python/site-packages/ but i notice that you ignore the venv folder , we use a common venv in my team to not flood our machines and it works fine

@ayush-mandowara-bst
ayush-mandowara-bst commented on Jan 8, 2021 via email 
What do you mean by common venv? In general, you should ignore your
environment and only keep a requirements.txt file in tracking.

I'll explicitly state how you can create a requirements file.

1. Activate your environment
2. pip freeze > requirements.txt

In your gitignore just add
<name of environment>/

And now add this to tracking
3. git add requirements.txt .gitignore
4. git commit -m 'adding requirements'
5. git push origin master

Now anyone who pulls the repo can (optionally) create their own environment
and install the requirements using

pip install -r requirements.txt

Hope this helps!

I mean the venv is on the repo when you clone it. I am gonna remove it like suggested, but i would like to make a script to create the venv( i mean the activate/deactivate/... Binaries and so on)

I do it all the time. I mostly use windows. Here's my bat file that does
some stuff for me:

```
@echo off
py -m venv env
type nul > env.bat
echo cd env\Scripts >> env.bat
echo call activate.bat >> env.bat
echo cd ..\.. >> env.bat
call env.bat
```

I have added the location of this bat file in my Environment variables.
Then I call it in whichever folder I want to create a new environment.
